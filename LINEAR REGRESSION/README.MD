# Filter outliers from your data set.
# Compute the linear regression on your filtered data set.
# Compute the  value from your filtered data and your linear regression function.
Here is the function specification. Name: linearRegression
## Inputs: 
* x-values of the data set
* y-values of the data set
## Outputs:
* Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* Slope from the linear regression (m in )
* Intercept from the linear regression (b in )
* Rsquared value
