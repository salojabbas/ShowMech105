# Inputs:
* A - coefficient matrix
# Outputs:
* L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
* U - upper triangular matrix
* P - the pivot matrix
##Remember, a correctly solved LU factorization solves for the problem P*A = L*U, which is a good check to make sure your solution is correct.
