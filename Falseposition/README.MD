## Inputs:
* func - the function being evaluated
 * the lower guess
 - the upper guess
es - the desired relative error (should default to 0.0001%)
maxit - the maximum number of iterations to use (should default to 200)
varargin, . . . - any additional parameters used by the function
## Outputs:
* root - the estimated root location
* fx - the function evaluated at the root location
* ea - the approximate relative error (%)
* iter - how many iterations were performed
